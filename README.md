# E-Commerce-Web-Application

I have worked with three other members to accomplish this project. This project is built in HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX and PHP. This project is about creating an ecommerce web application where sellers can sell their products online and customers can purchase products of their own choice. There are four types of users here- admin, manager, employee and customer. Admin has the control of the overall application. I have completed the admin part of the project. Some of the special features contain implementation of session, cookie, login authentication, PHP form validation, Javascript form validation, Database connection and AJAX.
