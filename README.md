# E-Commerce-Web-Application

I have worked with three other members to accomplish this project. This project is built in HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX and PHP. This project is about creating an ecommerce web application where sellers can sell their products online and customers can purchase products of their own choice. I have completed the 'Admin' part of the project. There are four categories of users here- 

* Admin
* Manager
* Employee
* Customer

Some of the special features contain implementation of-
* Session
* Cookie
* Login Authentication
* PHP form validation
* Javascript form validation
* Database connection
* AJAX
